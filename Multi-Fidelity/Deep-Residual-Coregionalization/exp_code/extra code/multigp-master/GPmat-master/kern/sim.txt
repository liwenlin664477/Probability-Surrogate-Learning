% The single input motif (SIM) kernel is specifically designed for
% working with gene networks where there is assumed to be a single
% transcription factor controlling several genes. If each gene is
% related to the transcription factor through the following
% differential equation,
%
% dx(t)/dt = B + C f(t-delta) - D x(t),
%
% where D is a decay term, C is a response term, delta is a time delay
% and B is an initial level. Then if f(t) is assumed to come from a
% Gaussian process with an RBF covariance function x(t) is a Gaussian
% process with a covariance function provided by the single input
% motif kernel.
%
% The kernel is designed to interoperate with the multiple output
% block kernel so that f(t) can be inferred given several different
% instantiations of x(t) (associated with different genes).
%
% The parameters (B, C, delta and D) are constrained positive.
