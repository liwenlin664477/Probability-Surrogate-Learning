% The fixed basis RBF kernel is a covariance function derived from considering a radial basis function style network with a Gaussian style basis and integrating out the weights of the basis. radial basis function kernel (RBF) is sometimes also known as
% the squared exponential kernel. It is a very smooth non-linear
% kernel and is a popular choice for generic use.
%
% k(x_i, x_j) = sigma2 * exp(-gamma/2 *(x_i - x_j)'*(x_i - x_j))
%
% The parameters are sigma2, the process variance (kern.variance)
% and gamma, the inverse width (kern.inverseWidth). The inverse
% width controls how wide the basis functions are, the larger
% gamma, the smaller the basis functions are.
%
% There is also an automatic relevance determination version of
% this kernel provided.
