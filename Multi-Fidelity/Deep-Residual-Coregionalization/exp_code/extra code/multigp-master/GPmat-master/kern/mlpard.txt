% The automatic relevance determination variant of the multi-layer
% perceptron kernel (MLP) is sometimes also known as the arcsin
% kernel. It is derived by considering the infinite limit of a neural
% network with erf() functions as the hidden layer activations.
%
% k(x_i, x_j) = sigma2*arcsin((w*x_i'*A*x_j + b) ...
%    /sqrt((w*x_i'*A*x_i + b + 1)*(w*x_j'*A*x_j + b + 1)))
% 
% As well as the diagonal matrix of input scales (kern.inputScales:
% constrained to be between zero and one) there are three parameters,
% the kernel variance (sigma2) stored in kern.variance, the variance
% of the weights in the neural network (w) stored in
% kern.weightVariance and the variances of the biases in the neural
% network (kern.biasVariance).
