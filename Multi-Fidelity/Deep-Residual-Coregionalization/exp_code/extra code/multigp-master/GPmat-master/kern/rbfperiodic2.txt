% This kernel is a periodic kernel constructed by mapping a one
% dimensional input into a two dimensional space,
%
% u_1(x) = cos(x), u_2(x) = sin(x)
%
% A radial basis function kernel is then applied in the resulting
% two dimensional space. The resulting form of the covariance is
% then
%
% k(x_i, x_j) = sigma2 * exp(-2*gamma *sin^2((x_i - x_j)/2)').
%
% The kernel, thereby, generates periodic functions in the space of
% (u_1, u_2).
%
% See Rasmussen & Williams (2006) page 92 and and MacKay's 1998
% introduction to Gaussian processes for further details.
% 
% In essence, this kernel is identical to the rbfperiodic one, the
% only difference is that rbfperiodic2 considers the period to be
% non-fixed, i.e. it is a parameter to be optimised and with respect
% to which the kernel's gradient must be calculated.
