% The bias kernel arises from placing a prior over the bias with a
% variance given by the kern.variance parameter. It allows the
% output function to move up and down. 
%
% This kernel is not intended to be used independently, it is
% provided so that it may be combined with other kernels in a
% compound kernel.
