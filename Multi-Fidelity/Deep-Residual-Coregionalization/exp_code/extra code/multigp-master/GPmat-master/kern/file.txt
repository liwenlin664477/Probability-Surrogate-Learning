% The file (FILE) kernel is designed for working with pre-computed
% kernel files that are saved on disk. It loads in a file the
% first time it is accessed and then caches it in memory (in single
% precision). The cacheing is done in by the fileKernRead command.
%
% This kernel type was originally written for working with Bill
% Stafford Noble's yeast data, available at
