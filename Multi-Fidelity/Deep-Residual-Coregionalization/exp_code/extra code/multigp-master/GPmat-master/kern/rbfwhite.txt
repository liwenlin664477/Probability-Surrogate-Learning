% The RBF-WHITE kernel is a convolutional kernel obtained as the result of
% convolving a white noise input process with an RBF smoothing kernel with
% range between zero and t.
%
% Although it be used independently, it is mostly intended to be combined
% with other kernels in a compound kernel. For example, this kernel could
% be used as variational smoothing kernel for the DTC sparse GP approach.
%
% The parameters are sigma2, the process variance (kern.variance), and
% gamma, the inverse width (kern.inverseWidth). The inverse width controls
% how wide the basis functions are, the larger gamma, the smaller the basis
% functions are.
%
% It is very similar to the RBF-WHITE-INF kernel.
