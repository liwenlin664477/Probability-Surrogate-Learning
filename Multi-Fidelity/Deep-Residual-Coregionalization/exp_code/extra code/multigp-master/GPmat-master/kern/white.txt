% The white noise kernel arises from assuming independent Gaussian
% noise for each point in the function. The variance of the noise is
% given by the kern.variance parameter.
% 
% This kernel is not intended to be used independently, it is provided
% so that it may be combined with other kernels in a compound kernel.
