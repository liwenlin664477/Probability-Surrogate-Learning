% The tensor product (TENSOR) kernel is a container kernel for
% allowing tensor products kernels of separate component kernels.
% several different kernels to be added together. It is created by
% using the kernCreate command with the kernel type given as a
% cell and the first entry given as 'tensor'. For example, to
% create a tensor kernel compound kernel that is composed of
% an RBF kernel and a LIN kernel you call,
%
% kern = kernCreate(X, {'tensor', 'rbf', 'lin'});
%
% Each individual kernel is then stored within the returned kernel
% structure. The kernels are stored in order in a field called
% 'comp'. So display obtain the 'rbf' kernel you write:
%
% kernDisplay(kern.comp{1})
%
