% The probit noise model is a classification noise model. It is based on the cumulative Gaussian. If the cumulative Gaussian is defined as
%
% \phi(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x N(z|0, 1) dz
%
% Then the probit noise model is \phi(y.*(mu+bias)/(\sqrt(sigma2 + varSigma)))
% where bias and sigma2 are parameters of the noise model, y is the true class and mu and varSigma are the input mean and variance.
