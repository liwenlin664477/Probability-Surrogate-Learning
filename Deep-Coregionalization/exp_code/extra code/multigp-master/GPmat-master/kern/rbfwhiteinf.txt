% The RBF-WHITE-INF kernel is a convolutional kernel obtained as the result
% of convolving a white noise input process with an RBF smoothing kernel
% with range between minus infinity and infinity.
%
% Although it be used independently, it is mostly intended to be combined
% with other kernels in a compound kernel. For example, this is the kernel
% used as variational smoothing kernel for the DTC sparse GP approach.
%
% The parameters are sigma2, the process variance (kern.variance), and
% gamma, the inverse width (kern.inverseWidth). The inverse width controls
% how wide the basis functions are, the larger gamma, the smaller the basis
% functions are.
%
% It is very similar to the RBF-WHITE kernel.
