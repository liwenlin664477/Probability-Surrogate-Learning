% Included for completeness, but generally not recommended, is the
% polynomial kernel,
%
%  k(x_i, x_j) = sigma2*(w*x_i'*x_j+b)^d
%
% The kernel parameters are sigma2 (kern.variance), w
% (kern.weightVariance), b (kern.biasVariance) and d
% (kern.degree). Only gradients of the first three are provided for
% kernel optimisation, it is assumed that polynomial degree would
% be set by hand.
%
% The kernel is not recommended as it is badly behaved when the
% w*x_i'*x_j + b has a magnitude greater than one. For completeness
% there is an automatic relevance determination version of this
% kernel provided.
