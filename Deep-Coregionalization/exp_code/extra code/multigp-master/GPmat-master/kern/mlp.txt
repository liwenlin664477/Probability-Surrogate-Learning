% The multi-layer perceptron kernel (MLP) is sometimes also known
% as the arcsin kernel. It is derived by considering the infinite
% limit of a neural network with erf() functions as the hidden
% layer activations.
%
% k(x_i, x_j) = sigma2*arcsin((w*x_i'*x_j + b) ...
%    /sqrt((w*x_i'*x_i + b + 1)*(w*x_j'*x_j + b + 1)))
% 
% There are three parameters, the kernel variance (sigma2) stored
% in kern.variance, the variance of the weights in the neural
% network (w) stored in kern.weightVariance and the variances of
% the biases in the neural network (kern.biasVariance). There is
% also an ARD variant of this kernel.
