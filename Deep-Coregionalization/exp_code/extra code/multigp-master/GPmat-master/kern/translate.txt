% This kernel allows you to take any other kernel in the tool box and
% translate with respect to the input space. With stationary kernels this is
% obviously pointless, but for non-stationary kernels (such as the LINEAR
% kernel or the MLP kernel) it moves the non-stationarities around the input
% space which is potentially useful.
