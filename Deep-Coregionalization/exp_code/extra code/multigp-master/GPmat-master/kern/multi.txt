% The multiple output block kernel (MULTI) is a wrapper kernel
% designed to represent the situation where there are several Gaussian
% processes with correlated outputs. The kernel stores the parameters
% of the kernels which form the block diagonal of the covariance
% matrix of the full process. Off diagonal blocks are the computed
% according to specified calling functions in the structure.
%
% The kernel structure was originally desined for operating with
% single input motif kernels in gene networks, where correlations
% between genes occur that are induced by an unobserved
% transcription factor concentration.
