% The white noise kernel arises from assuming independent Gaussian
% noise for each point in the function. The variance of the noise is
% given by the kern.variance parameter. The fixed white noise kernel
% is a simple variant of the white kernel that doesn't allow the noise
% parameter to be optimised. It is useful when the level of noise is
% known a priori.
% 
% This kernel is not intended to be used independently, it is provided
% so that it may be combined with other kernels in a compound
% kernel.
