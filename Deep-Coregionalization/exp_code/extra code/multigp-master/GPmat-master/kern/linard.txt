% The automatic relevance determination version of the linear
% kernel (LINARD) is the simple inner product kernel with feature
% selection applied.
%
% k(x_i, x_j) = sigma2 * x_i'*A* x_j
%
% where A is a diagonal matrix of values constrained to be between
% zero and one. These parameters are stored in the field
% 'inputScales'. There is also the parameter, sigma2, which is stored
% in the field kern.variance.
