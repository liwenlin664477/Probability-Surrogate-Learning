# Probability-Surrogate-Learning
This is a comprehensive machine learning library, specifically tailored for surrogate learning and active learning. Our objective is to provide a robust platform that empowers researchers and developers to seamlessly implement and experiment with these advanced machine learning techniques.

# IFHoGP-main(Scalable High-Order Gaussian Process Regression)
First of all, you need to download our [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ekh_rITLrXvPyThm7DSid8fl8YuyYQVK/view?usp=sharing) for testing and copy them into a folder named pde_data
You can easily run our code by running the following command:
```commandline
cd IFHoGP-main
ipython test_script.ipy
```

# Scalable-GPRN(Scalable Gaussian Process Regression Networks)

You can easily run our code by running the following command:
```commandline
cd Scalable-GRPN
ipython test_script.ipy
```
